                <h1>Rohil Verma</h1>
                <p>Hi - I'm Rohil, a junior at <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a> studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in applying state-of-the-art research to solve practical problems, and in establishing guarantees and failure cases for these techniques. Through this, I hope to avoid hype and instead create rigorous, well-understood solutions. <br>
In the past, I've done research in <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/acemoglu">political science</a> and <a href="http://starlab.mit.edu">aerospace</a> groups, and worked at <a href="https://enter.stone.com.br/">payments</a> and <a href="http://airfox.com">cryptocurrency</a> companies. In the summer of 2018, I worked at <a href="https://www.celect.com/">Celect</a> where I worked on demand estimation models. Starting next fall, I will be studying confidence metrics for neural networks in <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu">Prof. Daniela Rus'</a> autonomous driving lab.</p>

		Celect:  
		</font>
		</b>
		 At Celect, I worked on advancing their core demand estimation process, and on using the novel demand predictors to optimize assortments and choice counts for multibillion dollar retailers like Gap and Visionworks. I also worked on order forecasting models for Tommy Hilfiger.<br>
		The demand estimation algorithm I wrote was a matrix completion that modelled demand as a Poisson process. It takes both simple product, store and seasonality features and complex interdependencies into account. For example, it sees that products sell better during the holiday season (seasonality), but it also notes that some products sell more during the holidays while others do not (product-seasonality).

		Airfox:

		</b>
		While at Airfox, I worked with Node.js, Express, and Postgres, building the backend endpoints that responded to mobile app calls dealing with user accounts or finances. I also built deployment automation algorithms in Bash, which sped up Docker image deployment by an order of magnitude.

		Stone:
		</font>
		</b>
		During my summer at Stone I worked on engineering an automated weighing-payment product and building an Internet of Things software library.<br>
		In Brazil, employees lunch at <i>kilo</i> restaurants, where food is billed by weight and drinks and desserts may be purchased separately. I used a Raspberry Pi to interface between Stone's point-of-sales machines and restaurants' weighing machines, automating the process and saving restaurants money. <br>
		I also wrote a cross-platform software library in Python that provided a high-level communication interface for IoT devices. It implemented the MQTT protocol over TCP and allowed users to abstract away IoT device communication, allowing them to focus on application specific functions, such as temperature sensing or foot traffic measurement.
