                Hi - I'm Rohil, a junior at <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a> studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in applying state-of-the-art research to solve practical problems, and in establishing guarantees and failure cases for these techniques. Through this, I hope to avoid hype and instead create rigorous, well-understood solutions. <br>
In the past, I've done research in <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/acemoglu">political science</a> and <a href="http://starlab.mit.edu">aerospace</a> groups, and worked at <a href="https://enter.stone.com.br/">payments</a> and <a href="http://airfox.com">cryptocurrency</a> companies. In the summer of 2018, I worked at <a href="https://www.celect.com/">Celect</a> where I worked on demand estimation models. Starting next fall, I will be studying confidence metrics for neural networks in <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu">Prof. Daniela Rus'</a> autonomous driving lab.</p>

		Celect:  
		</font>
		</b>
		 At Celect, I worked on advancing their core demand estimation process, and on using the novel demand predictors to optimize assortments and choice counts for multibillion dollar retailers like Gap and Visionworks. I also worked on order forecasting models for Tommy Hilfiger.<br>
		The demand estimation algorithm I wrote was a matrix completion that modelled demand as a Poisson process. It takes both simple product, store and seasonality features and complex interdependencies into account. For example, it sees that products sell better during the holiday season (seasonality), but it also notes that some products sell more during the holidays while others do not (product-seasonality).

		Airfox:
		</font>
		</b>
		While at Airfox, I worked with Node.js, Express, and Postgres, building the backend endpoints that responded to mobile app calls dealing with user accounts or finances. I also built deployment automation algorithms in Bash, which sped up Docker image deployment by an order of magnitude.

		Stone:
		</font>
		</b>
		During my summer at Stone I worked on engineering an automated weighing-payment product and building an Internet of Things software library.<br>
		In Brazil, employees lunch at <i>kilo</i> restaurants, where food is billed by weight and drinks and desserts may be purchased separately. I used a Raspberry Pi to interface between Stone's point-of-sales machines and restaurants' weighing machines, automating the process and saving restaurants money. <br>
		I also wrote a cross-platform software library in Python that provided a high-level communication interface for IoT devices. It implemented the MQTT protocol over TCP and allowed users to abstract away IoT device communication, allowing them to focus on application specific functions, such as temperature sensing or foot traffic measurement.

		Syntactical Analysis of Weaknesses of Sentiment Analyzers:
		</font>
		</b>
		Two collaborators and I investigated the capabilities of two state-of-the-art sentiment analyzers, Google Natural Language and Stanford CoreNLP, from a syntactical perspective. We described the particular syntactic phenomenon that led to misclassifications of sentences under two structures: downward entailment and non-monotone quantifiers, and developed a set of sentences that ideal analyzers must be able to parse. The paper was accepted to <a href="http://emnlp2018.org/">EMNLP 2018</a> and is currently in press.

		Pre-training in Reinforcement Learning:
		</font>
		</b>
		With two others, I evaluated the effectiveness of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363">curiosity-based</a> pre-training and pre-training of the perceptual module on the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> dataset. We experimented with multiple <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">Gym</a> environments and observed that, for some environments, curiosity-based pre-training allowed the agent to solve the game better than an agent with no pre-training, but we did not observe a noticeable increase in the speed of convergence. Our code and paper are <a href="https://github.com/mschrimpf/unsupervised-rl-pretraining/">here</a>.

		Computational Biology:
		</font>
		</b>
		In the winter of 2017, I searched for subtypes of Alzheimer's disease, using the <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3219045">ROSMAP</a> dataset. I used RNAseq and methylation data to construct a similarity metric between patients and applied <a href="http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/SNF/SNF/Software.html">similarity network fusion</a>, a network fusion technique. I then experimented with agglomerative, hierarchical, spectral clustering and affinity propagation, and evaluated clusterings using silhouette score and adjusted NMI/Rand score.<br>
		While studying phylogenetic trees, I determined similar groups of trees by computing their Robinson-Foulds distance and applying aggregation clustering. By looking at cluster diameter and specificity I was able to evaluate clusterings.

		During the spring of 2017, I worked on thermal and structural optimization for miniature satellites called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat">CubeSats</a>. These satellites could transmit more data without degrading than traditional radio communication satellites.

		Economics:
		</font>
		</b>
		In winter 2016, I investigated whether political speech would decrease in polarization if opposing politicians were forced to spend more time with each other. The hypothesis was that in doing so, they would understand the other side's view, moderating their own. We found, however, that while there is an exchange of ideas and language between politicians of the same political coalition, it is not significant between politicians of opposing coalitions.<br>
